# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This Tic-Tac-Toe web application is a simple, interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to compete against each other on the same device, with Player 1 assigned "X" and Player 2 assigned "O". The game automatically detects wins, draws, and includes a restart option. To run the game locally, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tictactoe.git`, navigate to the project directory with `cd tictactoe`, and open `index.html` in your web browser. The folder structure includes `index.html` for the main file, `styles.css` for styling, `script.js` for game logic, and an `assets/` folder for any images or icons. The game is fully implemented using HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for logic. Contributions are welcome via pull requests, and the project is licensed under the MIT License.
